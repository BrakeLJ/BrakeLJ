## About Me
I am a software engineer who transitioned into tech from the restaurant industry in 2020 when the pandemic hit. Since then, I have transitioned from a non-tech role into a full-stack developer tackling complex features and challenges with Ruby on Rails, SQL, React, and TypeScript. I love writing code that impacts and helps people, that's why for the last three years I have worked in the education sector helping take burdens off of teachers so they can do what they love to do, teach.
