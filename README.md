## About Me
I used to be a chef but when the pandemic hit I took the chance to learn to code and make the career change I've wanted to make for years. I am deeply curious and love solving problems for people so it's a natural fit. I love coding in my off time but when I'm not it's likely that I'm: 

- 🥘 Cooking
- 🚲 Cycling
- 🐶 Walking the pup
- ⚔️ Playing D&D
- 👜 Leatherworking
- 🌲 Hiking
